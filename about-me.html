                <h3>My Favorite Activities</h3>

                    Hands-down my favorite thing to do with a group of friends and family is to gather around, relax, and play some games. Be it card game, board game, video games, or otherwise, I can always count on enjoying my time with others when there are games involved.
                </div>
                <div>
                    When I was growing up, we regularly had family game nights with things like Monopoly, Don't Break the Ice, and Battleship. This kind of gameplay is likely what helped to drive my ambition for competition and strategy, which then led to me diving into the world of trading card games in my early teen years. I started playing Magic the Gathering a lot with my friends, sometimes against their will, but I couldn't help it as I was hopelessly addicted.
                </div>
                <div>
                    This drive kept me wanting to get more into card games and explore more variety and depth than most of those around me. I never personally sought official competition, but at local gatherings, I greatly enjoyed showing off my personal creations. Eventually, I was unable to keep up with the cost of physically collecting cards, and moved to the online side as that started to come around with Hearthstone in 2014. I still play regulary to this day.
                </div>
                <div>
                    Outside of my nerdy obsession with trading card games, I often enjoy the plethora of family or group games I have accumulated over the years with things like Exploding Kittens, a game like Uno with a cental deck and cards with special abilities, or Cards Against Humanity, a more raunchy and comedic version of Apples to Apples.

                <h3>My Favorite Video Games</h3>

                <div>
                    Video games are a core part of my life and my personality. Playing video games is generally my go-to past-time. It's a core part of my friends' lives as well, as we usually end up playing my life-long favorite series, Super Smash Bros., any time we get together.
                </div>
                <div>
                    Aside from Super Smash Bros. being the glue that holds my social gatherings together, I have quite a diverse lineup of games that I love, both new and old. A lot of games have sentimental value to me usually do to being an important time in my life, or just a really good experience that I yearn to replicate.
                </div>
                <div>
                    Some examples of other games that hold a place in my heart are Metroid: Fusion and Final Fantasy Tactics Advanced: 2 (FFTA2). Metroid: Fusion was the first game I ever owned for the first gaming device I ever personally owned, the GameBoy Advance SP. We had some game consoles before that, for sure, but this one was just for me. 
                </div>
                <div>
                    FFTA2 is probably the best game I have ever played, hands-down. The character design, gameplay, customization, and strategy all combined to make an experience I have still yet to replicate to this day. If I ever get to the point in my life where I pursue creating my own game, this is easily going to be my primary inspiration.

                <h3>My Favorite Music</h3>

                <img src="images/grid-music.jpg" alt="a picture of the metal music group Slipknot, the first band I saw live" />
                <div>
                    For the majority of my life, I have been drawn to rock and metal music due to it's variety and complexity in sound while often touching on topics that are't often mentioned in other genres of music. 
                </div>
                <div>
                    As I have grown both in age and experience, I have come to appreciate a broader spectrum of music genres while still appreciating my roots in the rock scene.
                </div>
                <div>
                    While the only concerts I have attended to date are Slipknot and Three Days Grace, I look forward to seeing more live performances from some of my more recent favorite artists and groups such as bbno$, Lizzo, Oliver Tree, and Post Malone.

                <h3>My Favorite Video Entertainment</h3>
            </heading>
            <article>
                <img src="images/grid-video.jpg" alt="a picture of a still from my favorite TV show, Breaking Bad" />
                <div>
                    As a kid, I remember watching a lot of cartoons. Some of the shows that I watched the most were things like Courage the Cowardly Dog, Avatar: the Last Airbender, and SpongeBob SquarePants. One of the things I would say about this lineup is that they are all very unique with not a lot in common, but it catches the "playful" attitude I tend to have quite well.
                </div>
                <div>
                    I don't have as much time to watch television any more as an adult, so my choice in what I watch has gotten a bit more selective. That being the case has made YouTube a preferred video entertainment platform for me. It allows me to specifically curate not only what kind of entertainment I am looking for, but also allows for specific personalities to be selected as well. The primary forms of videos I tend to draw towards are comedy skits, engineering and mathematic edutainment, and personality-based psuedo-informational gaming content.
                </div>
                <div>
                    When I do decide to watch something else like a TV show or a movie, it's usually something I am very invested in. A prime example is the show Breaking Bad. The incredible characters, story, and cinematography consistently shown in every episode draws you into the world more than any other show I have watched to-date. I especially love the way there are no generic hero or protagonist characters. Every character is multiple layers deep, keeping you on the edge of your seat the entire ride.
