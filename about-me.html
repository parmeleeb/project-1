    Now, this is a story all about how <br>
    My life got flipped-turned upside down <br>
    And I'd like to take a minute <br>
    Just sit right there <br>
    I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air <br>
    In West Philadelphia born and raised <br>
    On the playground was where I spent most of my days <br>
    Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool <br>
    And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school <br>
    When a couple of guys who were up to no good <br>
    Started making trouble in my neighborhood <br>
    I got in one little fight and my mom got scared <br>
    She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air" <br>
    I begged and pleaded with her day after day <br>
    But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way <br>
    She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket <br>
    I put my Walkman on and said, "I might as well kick it" <br>
    First class, yo this is bad <br>
    Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass <br>
    Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like? <br>
    Hmm, this might be alright <br>
    But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that <br>
    Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat? <br>
    I don't think so <br>
    I'll see when I get there <br>
    I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air <br>
    Well, the plane landed and when I came out <br>
    There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out <br>
    I ain't trying to get arrested yet, I just got here <br>
    I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared <br>
    I whistled for a cab and when it came near <br>
    The license plate said, "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror <br>
    If anything I could say that this cab was rare <br>
    But I thought "Nah, forget it, yo, holmes to Bel Air" <br>
    I pulled up to the house about seven or eight <br>
    And I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo holmes, smell ya later" <br>
    I looked at my kingdom <br>
    I was finally there <br>
    To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air
